          <h4>HOW IT BEGINS</h4>
          <p>
            Two years ago, I arrived in Australia from Greece with no money, a
            dream in my heart and a determination to succeed.{" "}
            <span className="bg-[#cccccc] text-black">
              The journey was far from easy — filled with challenges, long days
              of hard work, and countless sacrifices.
            </span>{" "}
            But through perseverance, dedication, and an unwavering focus on my
            goals, I was able to turn my vision into reality.{" "}
            <b>
              <i>
                None of this would have been possible without my now-business
                partner
              </i>
            </b>
            . A Serbian native who grew up in Australia but spent years living
            in Serbia, he brought a unique perspective to the craft of
            barbering. When I first joined his barbershop, it was a small
            operation with four barbers. Through endless discussions and a
            shared passion for excellence, the business expanded and we grew
            together.

          <h4>WHY WE CREATES BARBERSHOP</h4>
          <p>
            As our collaboration grew stronger, we decided it was time to create
            something new - something that wasn’t existing - a space that would
            redefine men’s grooming.{" "}

                luxury, we created a one of a kind environment that blends
                premium services, innovative technology, and a stunning interior
